    "\n",
    "        - A baseline regressor, which could be a [K-nearest neighbours model](https://open.spotify.com/track/4R3AU2pjv8ge2siX1fVbZs?si=b2712f32da0e4358) or a linear model like [Lasso](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) or [Ridge Regressors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ridge_regression.html).\n",

    "    - *TIPS*: \n",
    "    \n",
    "        * Out of the suggested metrics above, [some are correlation metrics, but this is a prediction problem](https://www.tmwr.org/performance#performance). Choose wisely (and don't choose the incorrect options.) \n",

      "   In the above reference, the output \"area\" was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function.\n",
      "   Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were\n",
      "   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were\n",
      "   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two\n",
      "   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed\n",
      "   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:\n",
      "   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The\n",
      "   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve\n",
      "   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect,\n",
